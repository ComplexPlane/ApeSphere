# ApeSphere REL Loader
# Based on the TTYD-Practice-Codes REL loader written by PistonMiner and Zephiles

# 80006d10 - Address to hook for this code
# This is after mkb2.main_loop.rel is loaded and linked, but before its prolog runs

# TODO restart register usage from r31 and reorder?
# TODO consistent capitalization?
# TODO consistent blrl/bctr?
# TODO recomment some things, related to stack usage for example
# TODO include stack layout in comments in this file?
# TODO initialize register assignments to pointers on stack in one place?

# Stack Layout
# No heap is available, so we use the stack for temporary space
# | Size                   | Offset | Size   | Alignment |
# | ---------------------- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
# | CARDMount work area    | 0x220  | 0xa000 | 32        |
# | Small card file buffer | 0x20   | 0x200  | 32        |
# | CardFileInfo           | 0xc    | 0x14   |           |
# | "rel" string           | 0x8    | 0x4    |           |
# | LR Save                | 0x4    | 0x4    |           |
# | SP Save                | 0x0    | 0x4    |           |

# Register Assignments
# r31: Used to preserve r12 from hook point, which is the prolog function of the main_loop rel
# r30: REL prolog pointer, initially 0. Keeps track of whether a REL is loaded or not
# r29: CardFileInfo struct buffer, allocated on stack
# r28: REL module size, rounded up to multiple of 0x200 bytes
# r27: Card file buffer, allocated on stack
# r26: CARDMount work area, allocated on stack
# r25: REL module region, allocated on arena
# r24: REL BSS buffer, allocated on arena
# r23: Original arena low pointer
# r22: Pointer to "rel" on stack
