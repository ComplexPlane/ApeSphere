Thank you very much to the Super Monkey Ball and Paper Mario: TTYD hacking communities for your past work, expertise, contributions, and inspiration. This project wouldn't be possible without your help!

Huge shoutouts to the Super Monkey Ball speedrunning scene! Thank you for making it so fun to be a part of, and for inspiring this mod.

I owe a lot of thanks to Zephiles and PistonMiner, the creators of the [TTYD-Practice-Codes](https://github.com/Zephiles/TTYD-Practice-Codes) and [ttyd-tools](https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools) projects respectively upon which this project is heavily based. Thank you very much to Zephiles for writing the new REL loader and heap support as well!

Thank you to TheBombSquad for writing the ISO version of the REL loader.
