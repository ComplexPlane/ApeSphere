Thank you to:

**Zephiles** for the numerous code contributions. These include:

* The initial [TTYD-Practice-Codes](https://github.com/Zephiles/TTYD-Practice-Codes) framework of which this mod is based on
* The current REL loader Gecko code
* A custom heap implementation for the mod
* A revised REL loader which serves as both a Gecko and ISO loader (not yet included)
* A Super Monkey Ball 1 port of the REL loader (not yet included)

**PistonMiner** for the [ttyd-tools](https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools) framework, which provides everything you need to turn C++ into a .GCI savefile which can be loaded into a Gamecube game at runtime. In addition, thanks very much for the detailed answers to my romhacking-related questions.

**CraftedCart** for the substantial contributions to the Monkey Ball 2 decompile project, as well as the many large contributions to the Monkey Ball hacking and custom level scene on the whole.

**TheBombSquad** for his decompile contributions as well, and for writing the current version of the ISO REL loader.

**Alist and PetresInc** for providing insightful feedback on a pre-release alpha needed before publishing an initial beta version of the mod.

**The Monkey Ball speedrunning scene** for inspiring this mod! Thank you for being so fun to be a part of.
